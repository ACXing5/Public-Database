================ UserStory 001 - create db ================
Description:
- Give the user a way to create a new database
- Button on home page
- New page for database creation
- Input field to name database
- Button to return to home page

Definition of Done:
- Can create db
- Only allow db with a unique name to be created (no overwriting existing databases)
- Only submit if database name is not empty

Implementation:
- Since a db (a node) in Firebase cannot be empty and it must have a value,
an initial dummy entry will be added.
- View db will ignore the dummy entry --> this is set by having a dummy attribute
- Constraint: other nodes cannot have dummy as an attribute
